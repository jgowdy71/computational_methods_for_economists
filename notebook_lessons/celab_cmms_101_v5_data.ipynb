Since computer memory is just zeros (physical off) and ones (physical on), data is encoded in memory according to its **type**, that is, the pattern of zeros and ones that represent the data.  For example, **boolean data** (**True** and **False**) are encoded differently than **integers**, which are encoded differently than **floating point numbers**, which are encoded differently than character **strings**.  The nice thing about using a higher level language like Python is that it works with the different data encodings at a level mostly invisible to the programmer.   \n",
