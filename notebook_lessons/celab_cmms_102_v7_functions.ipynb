    "Functions are the core **abstraction tool** used in procedural programming.  When we `call` a function we give in `arguments` which will be processed inside the function and the result is then `returned` to the statement that made the call.  The code that processes the argument are hidden from view in the function and are expected to work as documented in the `doc string`.  \n",

    "In writing **clean code** functions are designed to do one thing well.  This concept is called **separation of concerns**. Designing functions in your programming is also called **modular programming** and the functions once written are often grouped together into a larger **category of concerns** in Python `modules`.\n",

    "In mathematics, a **function** is a binary relation between two sets that associates to each element of the first set exactly one element of the second set.  The words map, mapping, transformation, correspondence, and operator are all synonymous with the word function.  Let X and Y be sets, then f: X $\\to$ Y as a function, if and only if, for all x $\\in$ X, f(x) $\\in$ Y. We call X the **domain** of f and Y the **codomain** of f.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Note:** A function is uniquely represented by the set of all pairs $G=(x, f (x))$, called the **graph of the function**. When the domain and the codomain are sets of real numbers, each such pair may be thought of as the Cartesian coordinates of a point in the plane.  A popular means of illustrating a function is by showing its graph. \n",

    "A utility function represents a preference relation on tuples representing quantities of different goods.  For example, if we have two goods, food and water, where $x_f$ is the quantity of food consumed and $x_w$ is the quantity of water consumed then the **consumption bundle** is $c = (x_f, x_w) \\in \\mathbb R_+^2$. If given a choice between two consumption bundles c and c' a consumer chooses c' over c we say c' is **revealed preferred** to c.  Alternatively we can define a utility function for our consumer as $u: \\mathbb R_+^2 \\to \\mathbb R_+$ such that $u(c') > u(c)$, if and only if, our consumer **prefers** c' to c.   \n",

The output, $y$, of the process are sold to consumers at a price $p$.  Note $y$ is a quantity expressing the number of output units produced. The company's revenue is then given by the equation $r(y) = py$.  \n",

In addition each unit of $y$ has an additional variable cost which depends on the amounts of different inputs used in the process. We will let $w$ be the hourly wage rate paid to the operator of the machine, $e$ the cost per kilowatt of energy to run the machine, and $r$ the cost of a foot of filament (a raw material). We can now write the cost of producing output $y$ as with the following equation \n",
